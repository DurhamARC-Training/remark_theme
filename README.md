# Durham Remark theme

A [remark](https://remarkjs.com/) theme for
[Durham ARC](https://www.dur.ac.uk/arc/).

Also includes a more general theme adding mechanism.

First include the remark JavaScript into your HTML as well as this

```HTML
<script src="https://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://durhamarc-training.github.io/remark_theme/latest.js"></script>
```

Then before you create the remark slideshow, install the theme, and
then create the slides as normal.

```
durham.install();
var slideshow = remark.create({sourceUrl: 'README.md'});
```
